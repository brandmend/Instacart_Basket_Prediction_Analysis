## Overview
This analysis takes a look at over 3M rows of customer order data provided by Instacart. 


## Business Problem 
Understanding what makes up the average customer basket is extremely important for retailers to understand, especially in an online E-Commerce enviroment. Retailers utilize this kind of analysis to understand the associations between items, which influence a number of decisions retailers have to make in regard to merchandising, recommendation systems & promotional strategies (among others). 

Instacart, a grocery ordering and delivery app, aims to provide customers with a simple and personalized online grocery shopping experience. One of the major advantages online retailers have compared to traditional brick & mortor, is the ability to personalize a shopping experience to each individual customer. In 2017, Instacart released a dataset containing a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart customers. Utilizing this dataset, I performed a Market Basket Analysis and predicitive classification model to:
1. Identify frequent item sets to inform Instcart merchandising and recommendation widgets
2. Predict what products a customer will re-order in future orders 

The results of this analysis will have important implications for Instacart and help to optimize the way they recommend products to customers, merchandise products and structure promotions.
